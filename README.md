## 📂 **Stage 0 : Problem Statement**
### Problem Statement
- 8.1% of clients experience difficulties in loan repayment, while 91.9% have no issues. This presents an opportunity for the company to increase the number of clients who make timely payments while reducing repayment difficulties. This ensures safer loan distribution and has the potential to enhance profitability.

</p>

- A predictive strategy is needed to identify high-risk clients so that loans can be directed appropriately or rejected if they pose a risk of non-payment.

### Goal
- Develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of loan repayment difficulties.

### Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to project the risk of loan repayment difficulties.
- Identify patterns and key factors influencing repayment ability to support strategic decision-making.
  
### Business Matrics
-  ROC-AUC for evaluating model performance.

## 📂 **Stage 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis**
### Business Insight
<p>
- Housing Type of Clients

 alt="Housing">
</p>
<br>
Clients with Rented Apt and Office Apt in Region 1 have a higher risk of payment difficulties compared to Region 2, especially for medium loan amounts.
In Region 3, Rented Apt tends to face payment difficulties.
Office Apt in Region 3 mostly does not experience payment difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<br>
- Income Type of Clients

</p>
<br>
Maternity Leave: Payment difficulties are more common with cash loans than revolving loans.
Unemployment: 50% of cash loans are problematic, while revolving loans remain stable.
Student: All loans are performing well, with low to medium amounts.
</p>

<p>
<br>
- Distribution Age in Target

 alt="Age">
</p>
<br>
Clients with the highest payment difficulties are aged 20-30.
Clients aged 31-50 have no payment difficulties, though there is a slight decline in the 41-50 age group. This indicates better and more stable repayment ability.
</p>

 alt="Machine Learning Model">
</p>

Based on the table, the machine learning model that delivers the best performance is XGBoost, with cross-validation results on both train and test data showing no significant differences, indicating minimal overfitting or underfitting.
<br>

### Evaluation Model
<p align="center">

 alt="Evaluation Model">
</p>
Predictive Capability
With an ROC-AUC of 0.70, the model demonstrates a reasonably good performance in distinguishing between the "payment difficulties" and "no payment difficulties" classes.

</p>
DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE: A higher number of defaulting relatives increases the borrower's risk of default.
AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_MON: Frequent credit inquiries indicate a higher financial risk.
NAME_INCOME_TYPE: Stable income is more reliable than irregular income.
NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE: Higher education levels tend to increase earnings and financial stability.
LIVE_CITY_NOT_WORK_CITY: Differences in living and working locations may indicate financial constraints.
<br>

## 📂 **Stage 4 : Recommendation**
<br>
1. Offer long-term loans with low interest rates for clients aged 20-30.
Example: Education or renovation loans with flexible requirements.
<br>
2. Prioritize clients with stable income, higher education, and permanent housing.
Example: Lower interest rates for clients with stable jobs and good credit scores.
<br>
3. Tighten evaluation in Region 1 (Rented Apt) and optimize Office Apt in Region 3.
Example: Property loan discounts for office renters in Region 3.
<br>
4. Monitor clients with frequent credit inquiries or a history of default.
Example: Send payment reminders to encourage timely repayments.
